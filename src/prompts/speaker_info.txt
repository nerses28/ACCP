You are given a transcript of a multi-speaker meeting. Each line consists of a speaker ID and their corresponding utterance, formatted as:

speaker_id: text

Your task is to analyze all the utterances and extract available personal information about each speaker. This includes, if mentioned or implied:
- Full name (or first name if full name is not available)
- Job title or role (e.g., marketing expert, project manager)
- Estimated age (if stated or implied)
- Any other relevant demographic or professional information

Please return a JSON dictionary in the following format:

{
  "speaker_X": {
    "name": "val",
    "role": "val",
    "age": "val",
    "other": "val"
  },
  "speaker_Y": {
    "name": "val",
    "role": "val"
  }
}

If any information is missing or uncertain, omit the field rather than guessing.
