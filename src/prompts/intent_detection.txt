Your task is to assign the most appropriate intent label to a given target utterance, using the conversational context when available.

You must choose exactly one label from the following list of possible intents:

- Inform  
- Suggest  
- Assess  
- Elicit-Inform  
- Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion  
- Elicit-Assessment  
- Elicit-Comment-Understanding  
- Offer  
- Comment-About-Understanding  
- Be-Positive  
- Be-Negative  
- Other
