"Abstract:  \nThe meeting was focused on brainstorming and planning the design of a new, innovative remote control. The team, consisting of a project manager, a marketing expert, a user interface designer, and an industrial designer, discussed various aspects of the design process, including functionality, aesthetics, and market appeal. The goal was to create a remote that is modern, user-friendly, and sturdy, with a target price of 25 euros and a profit goal of 50 million euros.\n\nActions:\n- Corinne (Marketing Expert) will conduct research to determine the most universally appealing remote control designs and explore different designs for various target audiences.\n- The project manager will organize a more structured meeting for the next session to improve efficiency and preparedness.\n\nDecisions:\n- The team decided against a purely spherical design due to stability and functionality concerns.\n- They discussed a hybrid design that incorporates elements of a ball with grips for better handling, but ultimately leaned towards a more traditional, yet innovative design that is user-friendly and easy to handle with one hand.\n\nProblems:\n- The spherical design was problematic due to its tendency to roll and the potential weakness of hinges.\n- The challenge of balancing innovative design with functionality and cost considerations was noted.\n- The need to ensure the remote is intuitive to use, with clear orientation for pointing, was highlighted as a concern."
